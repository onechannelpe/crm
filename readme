The system is built around three constraints: minimal latency, strict data
integrity, and durable, mission-critical persistence. These constraints drive
both the architecture and the choice of tooling.

The project is organized as a single monorepo managed with bun workspaces. Code
is split between runnable systems under `apps/` and shared foundations under
`packages/`.

- The backend service lives in `apps/backend`. It owns persistence, validation,
  and API execution, and is going to be implemented with hono, libsql with
  kysely, and typia.
- The primary CRM frontend lives in `apps/crm` and is implemented with SolidJS.
- The browser extension lives in `apps/extension`. It is planned to be
  implemented with wxt and SolidJS, shares UI components with the CRM, and
  includes a WebRTC engine.

Shared infrastructure lives under `packages/`.

- `packages/api-contract` defines the canonical API contract, including shared
  TypeScript interfaces and runtime validation via typia.
- `packages/db` owns database schema definitions, migrations, and repository
  patterns built on Kysely.
- `packages/ui` provides shared SolidJS UI components and design primitives,
  styled with Tailwind CSS.
- `packages/config` contains shared TypeScript configuration.

Each app and package contains its own README with implementation-level details.
This file exists only to describe structure and boundaries.

The project is led by @totallynotdavid.
